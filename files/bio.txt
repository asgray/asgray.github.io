Hello, my name is Anthony Gray, and I am an interdisciplinary scientist, programmer and nature enthusiast based in the Seattle area. Officially, my training is in biology, but it also includes social sciences, computer science, and just a little bit of legal training. I enjoy putting my diverse background to use solving technical problems and communicating complex ideas in straightforward and approachable ways.

I am an avid learner with an interest in many subjects, from molecular biology to machine learning with a special interest in the behavior of systems. The effects of the environment on health and the interactions found within a metagenomic sample are examples of topics that I find fascinating. I have many other hobbies and interests including 3D art, simple robotics, and wilderness backpacking.
